    <title>Crew and passenger system</title>
    <shortdesc>Many pieces of equipment and systems that the crew and passengers use are only
        covered here, and not in other parts of the manual. This is largely due to the nature of
        these parts. They are largely just to make the crew comfortable. They don’t play a specific
        role in the ongoing operation of the vehicle.</shortdesc>
