    <title>Engine limitations</title>
    <shortdesc>While you can safely operate the engines at up to 100% of the power level, there is
        also a requirement to operate at a range of powers levels.</shortdesc>

        <section id="i721388"><indexterm>engine limitations</indexterm><p>An upper range of 109% has
                been set as a temporary override to the engine limits. This may be run for up to 600
                seconds of operation. </p><note type="caution"><p>Actual flight performance has not
                    been tested beyond time and power levels for more than 600 seconds. Exceeding
                    this can permanently damage the vehicle.</p></note><p>The primary computer
                system monitors the temperature of the turbopump components including:<ul>
                    <li><p>high pressure fuel pump</p></li>
                    <li><p>high pressure oxidizer</p></li>
                    <li><p>high pressure pump at low temperature</p></li>
                </ul></p><p>Temperatures exceeding operating limits will result in a main engine
                shutdown. If the captain has manually prevented this the temperature can be forced
                to exceed limits.</p></section>
