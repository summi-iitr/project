    <title>Cabin escape</title>
    <shortdesc>The cabin can also be evacuated through a self-enclosed ejection system. This system
        will result in quick depressurization of the cabin t match the surrounding pressure (so in
        space it will completely vacate the air from the cabin, but within the atmosphere it will
        normalize to the outside pressure.</shortdesc>
