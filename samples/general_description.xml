        <p>Flight used to depend on an aircraft engine and propeller. Todayâ€™s modern Personal
            Spaceship is ready to go with a hydrogen and oxygen mix in an external tank and solid
            rockets for auxiliary takeoff power.</p>

                <dd>A type of fan that converts rotating motions into thrust. This method of
                    powering flight is not applicable to your vehicle, but is a good historical
                    reference.</dd>

                <dd>A spacecraft obtains thrust from a rocket engine which is not reliant on the
                    atmosphere and work very well in space.</dd>
