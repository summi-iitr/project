 <conbody>
  <p>The attribute specifications on the resolved element <ph>(ph)_7_are</ph> drawn
      from both the referencing element and the referenced element, according to the following
      priority:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>(li)_8_All attributes as specified on the referencing element, except for attributes set to
        "-dita-use-conref-target".</li>
   <li>All attributes as specified on the referenced element except the <xmlatt>(xmlatt)_9_id</xmlatt>
        attribute.</li>
   <li>The <xmlatt>(xmlatt)_10_xml:lang</xmlatt> attribute has special treatment as described in <xref href="xmllang.dita"/>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The token <ph>-dita-use-conref-target is defined by the specification to
        enable easier use of <xmlatt>(xmlatt)_12_conref</xmlatt> on elements with required attributes. </ph>The
      only time the resolved element would include an attribute whose specified value is
      "-dita-use-conref-target" is when the referenced element had that attribute specified with the
      "-dita-use-conref-target" value and the referencing element either had no specification for
      that attribute or had it also specified with the "-dita-use-conref-target" value. If the final
      resolved element (after the complete resolution of any conref chain, as explained below) has
      an attribute with the "-dita-use-conref-target" value, that element <term outputclass="RFC-2119">(term)_13_MUST</term> be treated as equivalent to having that
      attribute unspecified.</p>
  <p>A given attribute value on the resolved element comes in its entirety from either the
   referencing element or the referenced element; the attribute values of the referencing and
   referenced elements for a given attribute are never additive, even if the property (such as
    <xmlatt>(xmlatt)_14_audience</xmlatt>) takes a list of values.</p>
  <p>If the referenced element has a <xmlatt>(xmlatt)_15_conref</xmlatt> attribute specified, the above rules
   should be applied recursively with the resolved element from one referencing/referenced
   combination becoming one of the two elements participating in the next referencing/referenced
   combination. The result should preserve without generalization all elements that are valid in the
   originating context, even if they are not valid in an intermediate context. </p>
  <p otherprops="examples">(p)_16_For example, if topic A and topic C allow highlighting, and topic B does
      not, then a content reference chain of topic A-to-topic B-to-topic C should preserve any
      highlighting elements in the referenced content. The result, however it is achieved, must be
      equivalent to the result of resolving the conref pairs recursively starting from the original
      referencing element in topic A.</p>
