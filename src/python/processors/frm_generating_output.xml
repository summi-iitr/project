<body class = "- topic/body "><p class = "- topic/p ">The increasing
number and variety of devices (smartphones, tablets, eBook readers)
on which users view documents demands that writers publish content
that is readable across these devices. However, the limited resources
of people and time makes it extremely expensive to build a different authoring
or publishing system for each output format. To enable its users
to write once and publish to multiple formats, FrameMaker provides
a stand-alone multi-channel, multi-device publishing solution. This
solution allows you to publish to the following output formats -
providing your readers with access to your documents across different
devices and different form factors:</p>
<ul class = "- topic/ul "><li class = "- topic/li "><p
    class = "- topic/p ">Responsive HTML5</p></li>

Help</p></li>
<li class = "- topic/li "><p class = "- topic/p ">Adobe Experience
Manager Mobile</p></li>
<li>Basic HTML</li></ul>
<p class = "- topic/p ">When you publish your FrameMaker content
to one or more of the output formats, the styles and settings of
the published output is defined by the FrameMaker template and content
that you use. For example, the style of the Heading1 format in your
template mapped to the H1 tag in HTML5 output is black, Times New
Roman, 18 px. Or, the output format name (Responsive HTML5) is the title
of the HTML output. However, you are not restricted to the out-of-the-box
styles and settings. The publishing solution allows you to easily
customize the output styles and settings on-the-fly from the same
publishing interface.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the following 3 .article files generated

<ul><li><p>Great_Pyramids.article</p></li>
<li><p>Amazon_Rainforest.article</p></li>
<li><p>Grand_Canyon.article</p></li></ul>

<body><p>When using FrameMaker books or DITA maps to create your
documentation, you can define TOC for your book. You can then use
multichannel publishing to display this TOC in any of the available output
formats. For example, on a Responsive HTML5 desktop layout the TOC
is displayed on the left, by default.</p>
<fig frame = "all"><image href = "images/frm_publish-toc.png"  height
= "135.359pt" width = "146.399pt" /></fig>
<p>When displaying a TOC in the published output, the different
levels of paragraphs should ideally display with appropriate indentation.
For example, the heading <i>What is FrameMaker</i> should display indented
to the right of the chapter title <i>Getting Started</i>. This provides
a clear indicator to a reader regarding the level of the specific
heading in the TOC.</p>
<section><title>Indent TOC items in a book</title><p>FrameMaker
indents the items in the TOC, based on any one of the values of
the following paragraph tag properties:</p><ul><li><p>First indent
(<i>Format</i> > <i>Paragraphs</i> > <i>Paragraph Designer</i> > <i>Basic</i> tab)</p></li>
<li><p>Font size (<i>Format</i> > <i>Paragraphs</i> > <i>Paragraph
Designer</i> > <i>Font</i> tab)</p></li>
<li><p>Font Weight (<i>Format</i> > <i>Paragraphs</i> > <i>Paragraph
Designer</i> > <i>Font</i> tab)</p></li></ul><p>When you define
the headings in the document template, you need to ensure that the
first indent, font size, or font weight values for each of the TOC
headings that appear in the published TOC appropriately set.</p><p>The
following example, shows a list of possible values for the headings
in a template:</p><p><dl><dlentry><dt>Heading1TOC</dt>
<dd>First Indent: 0.0"</dd>
<dd>OR</dd>
<dd>Font Size: 16 px</dd>
<dd>OR</dd>
<dd>Font Weight: Bold</dd></dlentry>
<dlentry><dt>Heading2TOC</dt>
<dd>First Indent: 0.5"</dd>
<dd>OR</dd>
<dd>Font Size: 14 px</dd>
<dd>OR</dd>
<dd>Font Weight: Regular</dd></dlentry></dl></p><note><p>FrameMaker
uses any one of the above properties to indent the TOC items.</p></note><p>For
details on how to generate a TOC for a book, see <xref outputclass

<section><title>Specify number of TOC items in a DITA map</title><p>When
you publish a DITA map, by default, the TOC displays up to four
levels of TOC headings: title.0|title.1|title.2|title.3|title-index.

want to display in the TOC. You can specify from 1 (title.0|title-index)

a document color separated, or have all objects in a document or
book trapped by printing to a PostScript file. Then have a commercial
printer process the PostScript file for you. Creating a PostScript
file in this way embeds instructions in the file. These instructions
conform to the Adobe Document Structuring Convention (DSC). DSC
enhances the performance of postprocessing products that perform
trapping and imposition. DSC also lets you take full advantage of products
that support Open Prepress Interface (OPI) version 1.3. OPI reduces
the hardware overhead for working with high-resolution color images.</p>
