<?Fm Condend DITA-Prolog?><body class = "- topic/body "><p class = "- topic/p ">The FrameMaker
mode is ideal for authoring content that need not be tied to a rigid
structure. The unstructured style of authoring relies on a template
to define the presentation of content. Font, paragraph, table, and
other formats are often based on style guides, and content writing
rules specified by editors. You, as an author, decide the content
flow and formatting. For example, depending on the nature of content,
you may include headings followed either by paragraphs or by graphics.
This means that in an unstructured authoring workflow, you create
relatively free-flow documents that are largely style-based.</p>

command search and execute tool</dt>
<dd><p>FrameMaker has hundreds of menu commands. At times, even
experienced users might find it a bit tedious to locate the required
command in the menus. FrameMaker (2017 release) comes with the powerful
search command feature. Using this feature, you can enter the name of
the command that you are looking for and the search command tool
returns the commands matching the search string. Once the required
command is located, you can execute the command from the tool itself.
The search command tool lists the commands and the corresponding
shortcut keys to invoke the command.</p><fig frame = "all"><image

<dlentry><dt>Mini TOC auto-update</dt>
<dd><p>A mini TOC in your document gets automatically updated when
you save or print that document. The other ways to update the mini
TOC are through the main menu (Edit > Update Book), or the context
menu.</p><p>For more information, see <xref outputclass = "fm:"

<dlentry><dt>Improved auto-spell checker</dt>
<dd><p>If you have enabled auto-spell check feature in FrameMaker,
you see a red squiggly line under all words as you type. This behavior
has now been improved. You will see the red squiggly line only after
you have typed the complete word, and the word is not available
in the dictionary. Also, the Hunspell dictionary has been updated
to provide you better spell-checking functionality.</p><p>For more
information, see <xref outputclass = "fm:" href = "frm_text_tx.xml#WSEAAD5A3B-FC22-4c2a-BB76-16EC81643B34_ver12.0">Spelling

<?Fm Condend DITA-Prolog?><body class = "- topic/body "><section><title>Search autocomplete</title><p>The
search field in the responsive HTML5 output now displays predictive
search results based on a few characters that you type. The entire
help content including the text in SVG images is now indexed and
is made searchable. The search results also display the minimum
count of appearance of the entered word or phrase in the published
output. The search results are ranked based on the frequency of
the search term's occurrence within the content.</p><image href

<section><title>Text search within SVG images in responsive HTML5
output</title><p>The latest responsive HTML5 output allows you to
search text within SVG images. SVG defines graphics in XML format,
which makes them readable. Using this property of the SVG graphics, FrameMaker
can now read the information stored in the SVG graphics’ <codeph>&lt;text></codeph>, <codeph>&lt;tspan></codeph>,
and <codeph>&lt;textpath></codeph> nodes. When you perform a search
in HTML5 output, information in the respective nodes within SVG
files is also read and displayed in the search results.</p></section>
<section><title>Support for DITA attributes in dynamic content filters</title><p>You
can now use the DITA attributes to generate dynamic content filters
for responsive HTML5 and mobile app outputs. A new Select Conditional
Attribute dialog has been introduced wherein you can specify the
DITA attribute to filter content.</p><image href = "images/dynamic-dita-attribute.png"
 scale = "60.00" /><p>For more information, see <xref outputclass
= "fm:" href = "frm_generating_output.xml#id154UK09G0BF">Generate
dynamic content output</xref>.</p></section>
<section><title>Dynamic Content Filters support for indexes</title><p>Earlier
the dynamic content filters would not work on index entries. If
a conditional tag was applied on the content for which there was
a corresponding index entry, the index entry would be visible even
if the content was hidden. This behavior has now been changed with
the display of the index entries being controlled by the dynamic
content filters. If the main content does not show up for the selected
filter, its corresponding index entry also gets hidden.</p></section>
<section><title>Manage styles from a single CSS file</title><p>Whenever
you generated an output, the publishing process would create a CSS
file for each document in your book or DITA map file. This would
make management of the CSS files a bit complex. You can now have
only a single CSS file in the published output to manage styles
across all documents in your book or map file. You can generate
a single CSS file by selecting <i>Merge topic styles to single CSS</i> option
in the Publish Settings dialog.</p><image href = "images/publish-general-settings.png"
 scale = "60.00" /><p>For more information, see the <xref outputclass
= "fm:" href = "frm_generating_output.xml#id147VF0N0MJB/id1716A0Y707H">General
settings</xref> section in <xref outputclass = "fm:" href = "frm_generating_output.xml#id147VF0CN0MN">Configure
publish settings</xref></p></section>
<section><title>Improved image and multimedia files management</title><p>Images
and multimedia files management has been streamlined in the latest
version of FrameMaker. Earlier, if an image file was referenced
at multiple places, then the publishing process would create as
many number of copies of the image file. This would increase the
size of the published output and also make it difficult to manage.
Now, if there are multiple references for an image file, there would only
be a single copy of that image in the published output.</p><p>In
addition, if the source document references image and multimedia
files across different folders, they all are stored under a single
folder in the published output. A folder named <codeph>assets</codeph> is
created within the root folder of the published output and all image
and multimedia files are placed under this folder. All references
in the published output are automatically updated to point to the
resource in the <codeph>assets</codeph> folder.</p></section>
<section><title>Better handling of inline styles</title><p>If your
source document has inline styles applied, then you can control
the way you want them in your published output. For example, if
you have applied a style on a specific paragraph and you don't want
that style in your final output, then you can select <i>Cleanup
Inline HTML Styles</i> option in the General Setting of the Publish
Setting dialog. Once you select this option, all inline styles are excluded
from the final output. However, if you do not select this option,
the style is published as an inline style in your output.</p></section>
<section><p>For more information, see the <xref outputclass = "fm:"
href = "frm_generating_output.xml#id147VF0N0MJB/id1716A0Y707H">General
settings</xref> section in <xref outputclass = "fm:" href = "frm_generating_output.xml#id147VF0CN0MN">Configure
publish settings</xref></p></section>
<section><title>Publish all topic into a single folder</title><p>You
can split topics based on your paragraph style mappings. A folder
with the file name of your topic in the book or DITA map is created
in the final output. And, all HTML files are saved under these topic
folders. If you do not want to have multiple folders in your final
output, you can save all HTML files within a single folder. To do
so, you simply select the <i>Keep all topics in one folder</i> option in
the General Settings of the Publish Settings dialog. Once you select
this option, all topic HTMLs are saved under a folder named <codeph>topics</codeph>.</p></section>
<section><title>New basic HTML output generation support</title><p>A
Basic HTML output format has been added into the existing bucket
of output formats that you can generated from FrameMaker. The Basic
HTML output format takes each topic file within your book or DITA
map and generates a corresponding HTML file with the similar look-and-feel
controlled through a CSS file. The output is generated without any
JavaScript or custom layouts. This type of output is extremely light
and easy to share with your intended audience.</p></section>
<section><title>Table of contents and index improvements</title><p>The
layout of table of contents and index has been enhanced which makes
them cleaner and intuitive. Also, the format of storing index data
has been changed from XML to JSON. Unlike XML, which requires an
XML parser, JSON can be parsed by any programming language such
as JavaScript, C, Python, and many more. Because of lightweight
data-interchange format of JSON, it improves the search experience
of index entries.</p></section>
<section><title>Context-sensitive help support in DITA 1.3</title><p>You
can now use the <codeph>resourceid</codeph> element of DITA 1.3
to provide information to the context-sensitive help systems. FrameMaker
supports generating Responsive HTML5 and Microsoft HTML Help outputs
with context-sensitive help.</p></section></body></topic></topic>
